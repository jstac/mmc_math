Abstract
-----------

We discuss stability of discrete-time Markov chains satisfying monotonicity
and an order-theoretic mixing condition that can be seen as an alternative to
irreducibility.  A chain satisfying these conditions has at most one
stationary distribution. Moreover, if there is a stationary distribution, then
the chain is stable in an order-theoretic sense.
